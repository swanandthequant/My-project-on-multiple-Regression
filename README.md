## datasets
I used a very Good Dataset of Fetch_california_housing From sklear.datasets in

## Methodolody
1. Model Training(I just did the implementation of multiple Regression as there was no need of data cleaning in this)
2. Model Evaluation (using mean_squared_error,mean_absolute_error,root_mean_squared_error,R2_score,Residuals)
3. pickling

### what I learned 
by this project it was simple project But I learned about Multiple Regresssion which is One of the most imp Regression Topics 
and many of the Function of this

## Project Updates
Hey there this is not the project which I was telling about in my last Repositary But as I told in description the project will be coming soon
As this only my second project on Regression there can be some mistakes and I will be uploding more projects on classification and regression in one go because I have a long time ago but I didnt get thetime to post them so I am now posting them
Thank you everyone
